## Planning story

After building the database, it was necessary to build a client application to interact with the database. In order to do so it was necessary to determine what routes were used by the database, to know how to communicate, and based on the responses it was possible to build functionalities in the front end. Throughout the creation of the client it was crucial to test the functionalities with console logs to read the errors that occurred, and to fix them. After fulfilling the basic requirements it was neccesarry to go back and review the code to fix any issues or bugs, that may affect the user experience.
